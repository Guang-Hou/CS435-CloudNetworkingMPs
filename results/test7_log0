   Saw a new neighbor 255
 Created LSA packet. fromId 0, destId 0, distance: 0, nexHop 0, and nodesInPath [0].
 Inside sharePathsToNewNeighbor, sharing my path fromId 0 -> destId 0 to my neighbor 255, the nodes are [0].
 Received LSA from neighbor 255, for destId 255, the distance is 0, the nexHop is 255, and its PATH is: [255].
 I do not have a path to desId 255, but neighbor 255 has, I will use it.
 Received LSA from neighbor 255, for destId 2, the distance is 55, the nexHop is 1, and its PATH is: [255,1,2].
 I do not have a path to desId 2, but neighbor 255 has, I will use it.
 Received LSA from neighbor 255, for destId 5, the distance is 3, the nexHop is 1, and its PATH is: [1,255,5].
 I do not have a path to desId 5, but neighbor 255 has, I will use it.
 Received LSA from neighbor 255, for destId 4, the distance is 2, the nexHop is 1, and its PATH is: [255,1,4].
 I do not have a path to desId 4, but neighbor 255 has, I will use it.
 Received LSA from neighbor 255, for destId 6, the distance is 2, the nexHop is 1, and its PATH is: [255,1,6].
 I do not have a path to desId 6, but neighbor 255 has, I will use it.
 Received LSA from neighbor 255, for destId 1, the distance is 1, the nexHop is 1, and its PATH is: [255,1].
 I do not have a path to desId 1, but neighbor 255 has, I will use it.
 Received LSA from neighbor 255, for destId 2, the distance is 4, the nexHop is 1, and its PATH is: [255,2,3,4,1].
 We both have paths. Neighbor 255 has a better path to desId 2, I will use it.
 Received LSA from neighbor 255, for destId 7, the distance is 3, the nexHop is 1, and its PATH is: [255,1,4,7].
 I do not have a path to desId 7, but neighbor 255 has, I will use it.
 Received LSA from neighbor 255, for destId 3, the distance is 3, the nexHop is 1, and its PATH is: [1,4,255,3].
 I do not have a path to desId 3, but neighbor 255 has, I will use it.
 Received send or fowd message.

 Received LSA from neighbor 255, for destId 2, the distance is 4, the nexHop is 1, and its PATH is: [255,1,5,2].
 We both have paths. Neighbor 255 has a better path to desId 2, I will use it.
 Received LSA from neighbor 255, for destId 3, the distance is 5, the nexHop is 1, and its PATH is: [3,2,255,5,1].
 We both have paths. Neighbor 255 is my current nextHop and it got a worst path to desId 3, then I lost my path to this destId.
 Received LSA from neighbor 255, for destId 4, the distance is 1, the nexHop is 1, and its PATH is: [255].

 Received LSA from neighbor 255, for destId 7, the distance is 5, the nexHop is 1, and its PATH is: [255,1,7,6].
 We both have paths. Neighbor 255 is my current nextHop and it got a worst path to desId 7, then I lost my path to this destId.
 chooseAlternativeForLostPaths: chose alternative path neighbor 255 to destId 7,and nodesInPath [7,6,1,0,255].
 chooseAlternativeForLostPaths: chose alternative path neighbor 255 to destId 3,and nodesInPath [0,3,2,255,5,1].
 Created LSA packet. fromId 0, destId 7, distance: 560, nexHop 255, and nodesInPath [7,6,1,0,255].
